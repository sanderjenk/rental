# Rental

## Requirements

The requirements can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xcvgj6U8pY7OaDbBYju1Uw4wGTWmf8P-6R3nWqw18ZQ).

## Architecture

This project is composed of a .NET Core 3.1 back end and Angular 10 front end.

## Running the project locally

1. To start the fron end project open the command line in ClientApp directory and run `npm install` and then `npm start` (or `ng serve` if you have Angular CLI installed).
2. Start the back end project by running the Rental.sln solution in Visual Studio. If Visual Studio doesn't restore NuGet packages automatically, then this has to be done first.
